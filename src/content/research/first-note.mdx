## Summary
- Orion Labs publishes research when it is complete and technically useful.
- We focus on reproducibility where appropriate, and we avoid sensitive operational disclosure.
- Posts follow a consistent structure to support readers and reviewers.

## Publication boundaries
When a topic intersects with sensitive environments, publications:
- remove identifying details,
- report generalized findings,
- prioritize mitigations and engineering guidance over unnecessary exploit detail.

## Standard structure
Most posts include:
- threat assumptions,
- methodology and evidence,
- findings,
- mitigations and limitations.
